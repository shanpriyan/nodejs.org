# TEMPORARY NEXT.JS MIGRATION

This folder is mostly used to handle Handlebars Template Engine Scripts/Replacements/Functions; These will be removed or migrated to JSX Hooks/JavaScript with the Next.js migration. All remaining scripts will be kept (such as the load-versions, release-post).

**Note.:** This README is temporary and will be updated accordingly.
